# DrugData_AdverseEvents

This project aims to assess the relationship between inactive ingredients in different drugs and adverse events, offering potential insights into pharmaceutical safety. With drugs defined broadly as substances for treating or preventing disease, understanding the impact of both active and inactive components is crucial for ensuring medication safety. While extensive studies typically focus on active ingredients, this project shifts attention to the often-overlooked inactive ingredients, recognizing their potential influence on adverse reactions.
The methodology involves gathering and evaluating data from various sources, including the FDA and DailyMed, using techniques such as web scraping and data manipulation. The dataset comprises information on adverse events, drug properties, and active as well as inactive ingredients, which are processed and merged for analysis. The data extraction is followed by evaluation, unsupervised and supervised learning. 
Challenges in data quality and complexity are addressed through meticulous preprocessing and feature engineering. Risk assessment, based on severity and outcome of adverse events, serves as the foundation for model development. The project focuses on documentation and risk management to ensure robustness and reproducibility
In conclusion, while this project represents a comprehensive effort to explore the role of inactive ingredients in drug safety, initial findings indicate the absence of such a relationship. Further research and additional features are necessary to deepen understanding and potentially enhance predictive capabilities.
